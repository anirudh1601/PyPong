Installation:
	Make sure Pygame is installed in your machine.
	Run this command under a command prompt:
		python pong.py

Goal of the game:
	The goal of the game is to not let the ball touch your side of the "court."
	To accomplish this, you must move your platform so the ball can bounce
	off of it and move direction. The ball will progressively get faster overtime
	a player hits it.
	
	In two player mode, you will simply play against each other in an effort to
	have the other player lose.

	In one player mode, you will strive to get the highest score possible. 
	Through out the game a boss will appear as your score gets higher. He 
	will eventually start shooting fireballs at you and if any of them touch you
	then the game ends.

Controls:
	One player mode:
	Player 1:
		Move up: Up key
		Move down: Down key

	Two Player mode:
	For Player 1 (Left):
		Move Up: W
		Move Down: S
	For Player 2 (Right):
		Move Up: Up key
		Move Down: Down key

Methods:
	The ball object isn't allowed to move outside the working window. It will
	change directions whenever it collides with either the floor or ceiling, or one
	of the players. Every time it hits something it will play a sound. The ball
	has an incrementing left and right speed that will keep incrementing every
	time it collides with a player. The up down speed will be determined by
	where it collides with the player. The farther to the edges, the faster the
	up/down speed will be making it harder for the opposing player to bounce
	the ball back.

	For one player mode, the boss created becomes alive whenever the score
	reaches a certain threshold. The highscore is pickled in order to save the
	highest previous score. The fireballs that the boss fires are fired randomly and
	get fired more frequently as your score goes up.
